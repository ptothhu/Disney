		<li class="question">How can you track whether an HTML mail has been opened?</li>
			<p class="answer">In a HTML type email a tracking script or a tracking image/pixel will be placed in the email itself. The message is considered as opened if the script was executed the first time or the tracking pixel gets downloaded.</p>
		<li class="question">How can you track whether a text-only mail has been opened?</li>
			<p class="answer">Text e-mail do not contain any additional items (scripts, images etc.) so there is no way to track the delivery or read status of these e-mails.</p>
		<li class="question">How can you track that your visitor on your web page came from a link on your newsletter?</li>
			<p class="answer">For this feature you need to use a link/click tracking service. The tracking allows you to see which subscribers clicked links in your newsletter. When click tracking is enabled the service provider adds tracking information to each URL. When a subscriber clicks a link in the newsletter, the tracking information redirects the subscriber through the service provider's servers and sends them to the intended web address. That redirect will be logged in a service report.</p>
		<li class="question">How can you send an email in some other persons name? (technically, not legally)</li>
			<p class="answer">E-mail address and e-mail account are different things. Most e-mail service client application can be set different for the account details and e-mail address (From address) details. The e-mail address needs to be altered to perform it.</p>
		<li class="question">Which one(s) are valid DNS record type(s)?</li>
			<ol type="a">
			<li class="answercorr">CNAME</li>
			<li class="answer">RNAME</li>

			<li class="answercorr">DNAME</li>
			<li class="answer">SNAME</li>
			</ol>
		<li class="question">Correct the following SQL query and name the SQL version you used:</li>
			<p class="answer">PLEASE SELECT * IN TABLE WHERE COLUMN A IS EQUAL 8 ORDER RANDOMLY</p>
			<p class="answer">SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE A=8 ORDER BY RAND();</p>
		<li class="question">Write an Excel expression which extracts the country domain from the following URL: http://disney.de</li>
			<p class="answer">=LEFT(url,FIND("/",url,9)-1)</p>
		<li class="question">What is the difference between Page Views, Page Visits and Unique Visitors of a web page? How would you count them in order to get a reliable result?</li>
			<p class="answer">Page views represent the total number of pages that visitors looked at on our site.<br>
			Page visits represent the number of times the website was visited, without regard to repeat visitors.<br>
			Unique visitors represent the number of actual people that visited our site.<br>
			If you visit a website today and look at 3 pages, that would count as 1 visit and 3 page views.<br>
			If you return to the same website another day and look at the same pages again, that will count as 1 more visit and 3 more page views. However, it will only count as 1 visitor since it is the same person visiting twice.<br>
			If someone else visits the same website today and looks at those pages that will count as 1 visit, 1 visitor, and 3 page views.</p>
		<li class="question">What is the difference between a HTTP 301 and a 302 redirect?</li>
			<p class="answer">Both are HTTP redirectional status codes indicating that the client must take additional action to complete the request.<br>
			HTTP 301: Permanent URL redirection. Current links or records using the URL that the response is received for should be updated.<br>
			HTTP 302: Found but temporarily redirected.  The browser is invited by a response with this code to make an identical request to the new URL specified in the location field.</p>
		<li class="question">What is the web technology you most like and was invented in the last couple of years? Why?</li>
			<p class="answer">For me it is the development of HTML5 and CSS3 together.The markup language's new semantic elements, form control attributes, graphic and multimedia elements are able to enrich the semantic content of documents. Focusing on the static content the non-standard markup elements and attributes (styling) have been deprecated and their function is better handled by the style sheets. The style sheets are used to define styles for web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. The use of external style sheets can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file.</p>
